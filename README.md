The Name Quiz app

Write test-cases using Espresso for your app! At least have the following test cases: 

* clicking a button in the main-menu takes you to the right activity (testing one button is enough);

* is the score updated correctly in the quiz (submit right/wrong answer and check if the score is correct afterwards);

* a test that checks that the number of registered pictures/persons is correct after adding/deleting an entry. 

Use Gradle either from the command line or through Android Studio's Gradle tool window to install and run the test-cases, 
so that we can closely observe the steps that are necessary.
